# SVM Optimization and Bayesian Tuning

This project provides a comprehensive study of Support Vector Machines (SVMs), covering model training, margin visualization, hyperparameter tuning and performance evaluation. It includes comparisons between SVMs and neural networks and explores both traditional grid search and Bayesian optimization techniques for model tuning.

## Key Topics Covered

- Linear and nonlinear SVMs with different kernels
- Margin visualization and decision boundary plots
- Comparison with neural networks using MLPClassifier
- Grid Search vs. Bayesian Optimization
- Learning curves and model generalization analysis
- Custom wrappers for neural network hyperparameter tuning

## Tools

- Python
- scikit-learn
- scikit-optimize (`skopt`)
- matplotlib
- NumPy
